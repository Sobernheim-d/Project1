This app is a workplace safety visual identifier.  Our application is for company owners/ employees maintain safety standards regarding Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).  

Motivation – To have an automated process to insure employee safety.  Automation helps to cut time and cost.

Results – We are able to automatically analyze images through API which identifies if they are PPE compliant. The result is provided through an additional API in a creative and fun fashion.

Team Efforts – Volunteered based on strength and supported each other throughout the entire project. 

Individual Responsibilities:

Anibal - majority of the JavaScript, support for entire project

Bianca - CSS, Materialize

David - Main idea, javascript support, biometrics, API research

Robert- Main idea, full support (javascript, CSS)

Challenges-

Layout- getting the layout of the images was a huge challenge because we desired 5 images when the grid is setup for blocks of 12.

Logic was complex.

Future improvements:  

Bianca - Full Body Recognition PPE
Anibal - Detect a real person vs just a picture
Robert - Use for all industries ex: hair net for cook 
David - Real-time tracking location and specific zones of the work site and possible violations after initial check. Also include positive feedback when an employee is consistently compliant.
