          Worker Safety: Check-in code to make sure you are safe and ready to go
          for work!
        </p>
        <p>
          Working here at XYZ Construction corporation means that you are ready,
          rested, and have your proper personal protective equipment (PPE) on.
          For XYZ construction sites, that means you are wearing your safety
          glasses and hardhat on!
        </p>
        <p>
          want to make sure that we meet the ASME standards for construction
          sites and, more importantly, keep you safe from falling objects, or
          hitting your head when you go around a corner. Your safety glasses
          will protect probably your most valuable of your seven senses: your
          eyesight. Flying objects, dust, grit, sand, are all blocked when you
          are wearing your proper safety glasses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once your photo is snapped, Check-in will insure that you are ready to
          go! If any problems, please call your supervisor. Have a great day!!
