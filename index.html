        Worker Safety: Check-in code to make sure you are safe and ready to go
        for work! Working here at XYZ Construction corporation means that you
        are ready, rested, and have your proper personal protective equipment
        (PPE) on. For XYZ construction sites, that means you are wearing your
        safety glasses and hardhat on! We want to make sure that we meet the
        ASME standards for construction sites and, more importantly, keep you
        safe from falling objects, or hitting your head when you go around a
        corner. Your safety glasses will protect probably your most valuable of
        your seven senses: your eyesight. Flying objects, dust, grit, sand, are
        all blocked when you are wearing your proper safety glasses. Once your
        photo is snapped, Check-in will insure that you are ready to go! If any
        problems, please call your supervisor. Have a great day!!
